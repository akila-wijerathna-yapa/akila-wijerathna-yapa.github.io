title: "DNA Extraction Protocols"
---

DNA extraction is a fundamental procedure in molecular biology, underpinning a vast array of downstream applications including PCR, sequencing, cloning, and genotyping. An effective DNA extraction protocol must efficiently lyse cells, protect nucleic acids from degradation, and purify DNA away from proteins, polysaccharides, and other contaminants.

This page outlines the logic behind DNA extraction, common reagents and their biochemical functions, and principles for optimizing protocols across various sample types.

### 1. Logic Behind DNA Extraction

A successful DNA extraction protocol typically involves the following sequential steps:

1. **Cell lysis**: Disrupts cell membranes and releases intracellular components.
2. **DNA stabilization**: Inhibits nucleases that degrade DNA.
3. **Protein and contaminant removal**: Precipitates or separates proteins, lipids, and polysaccharides.
4. **DNA precipitation or binding**: Concentrates and isolates DNA.
5. **DNA wash and elution**: Removes residual contaminants and recovers purified DNA.

These steps can be adapted to suit the biological material (plant, animal, microbial, or environmental) and intended downstream application.

| Reagent                    | Function                                                                 |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Tris-HCl**               | Buffers pH and maintains a stable environment for DNA integrity          |
| **EDTA**                  | Chelates divalent cations (e.g., Mg²⁺), inhibiting DNases                 |
| **SDS (Sodium dodecyl sulfate)** | Disrupts lipid membranes and denatures proteins                         |
| **CTAB (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide)** | Binds polysaccharides and removes complex carbohydrates (plant DNA)     |
| **Proteinase K**          | Degrades proteins, including histones and nucleases                      |
| **Phenol-chloroform**     | Separates proteins from nucleic acids via phase separation              |
| **Isopropanol or Ethanol**| Precipitates DNA from aqueous solution                                  |
| **NaCl or KCl**           | Enhances protein precipitation and stabilizes DNA structure              |
| **RNase A**               | Degrades RNA to purify DNA preparations                                  |

### 3. Optimizing a DNA Extraction Protocol

Optimizing DNA extraction requires balancing purity, yield, and integrity while minimizing cost and time. Consider the following:

#### a) Sample-Specific Challenges
- **Plants:** High levels of polysaccharides and polyphenols can inhibit downstream reactions. Use CTAB and PVP.
- **Animal tissues:** Rich in proteins and lipids. Proteinase K and SDS are essential.
- **Microbes:** Require mechanical lysis (bead beating) or lysozyme digestion.
- **FFPE samples:** Require deparaffinization and prolonged proteinase digestion.

#### b) DNA Quality Metrics
- **A260/A280 ratio (~1.8):** Indicates protein contamination.
- **A260/A230 ratio (>2.0):** Indicates salt or phenol contamination.
- **Gel electrophoresis:** Assesses integrity and shearing.

#### c) Inhibitor Removal
- Use silica column purification or magnetic beads for clean-up.
- Incorporate wash buffers with ethanol and Tris to remove carryover.

#### d) Yield Maximization
- Minimize sample loss during transfer steps.
- Avoid over-drying DNA pellets.
- Elute in low-salt buffer (e.g., 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0) or nuclease-free water.

### 4. A Standard CTAB-Based Plant DNA Extraction Protocol (Example)

**Materials:**
- CTAB buffer (2% CTAB, 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 20 mM EDTA, 1.4 M NaCl)
- β-mercaptoethanol (freshly added)
- Chloroform:Isoamyl alcohol (24:1)
- Isopropanol
- Ethanol (70%)

**Steps:**
1. Grind ~100 mg fresh/frozen leaf in liquid nitrogen.
2. Add 700 µL prewarmed CTAB buffer + 1% β-mercaptoethanol.
3. Incubate at 65°C for 30 minutes.
4. Add equal volume of chloroform:isoamyl alcohol. Mix and centrifuge.
5. Transfer aqueous phase. Add 0.7 volume of cold isopropanol.
6. Incubate at -20°C for 1 hour. Centrifuge and pellet DNA.
7. Wash pellet with 70% ethanol. Air-dry.
8. Resuspend in TE buffer or nuclease-free water.
