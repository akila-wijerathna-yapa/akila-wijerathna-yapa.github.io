title: "Yeast Two-Hybrid Protocols"
---

The yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) system is a classical molecular biology technique used to study protein–protein interactions in vivo. It relies on the modular nature of transcription factors and enables the detection of binary interactions by reconstituting a functional transcriptional activator in yeast.

---

### Logic of the Y2H System

The Y2H system is based on the principle that transcription factors consist of two separable domains:

- **DNA-Binding Domain (BD)**
- **Activation Domain (AD)**

In the Y2H assay:
- A protein of interest (the "bait") is fused to the BD.
- A potential interactor (the "prey") is fused to the AD.

If bait and prey proteins physically interact, the BD and AD are brought into proximity, reconstituting a functional transcription factor that drives the expression of a reporter gene (e.g., HIS3, ADE2, lacZ, or GFP).

### Chemicals and Their Functions

| Chemical/Reagent              | Function                                                                    |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Selective media (SD/-Leu/-Trp/-His)** | Enables selection of transformants and reporters based on plasmid markers   |
| **3-Amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT)** | Competitive inhibitor of HIS3; increases assay stringency                   |
| **X-gal or ONPG**             | Substrates for β-galactosidase activity in lacZ reporter assays              |
| **DMSO**                      | Solvent for chemical substrates (e.g., X-gal)                                |
| **PEG/LiAc/ssDNA**            | Used in yeast co-transformation (see yeast transformation protocol)          |
| **Dropout supplements**       | Provide defined nutritional backgrounds for selective media                 |

### Y2H Protocol Overview

1. **Plasmid Construction**  
   Clone bait and prey genes into compatible vectors containing BD and AD domains, respectively.

2. **Yeast Co-transformation**  
   Introduce both bait and prey plasmids into competent yeast cells (typically AH109 or Y2HGold strain) using the LiAc/PEG method.

3. **Selection of Transformants**  
   Plate on SD/-Leu/-Trp (double dropout, DDO) media to select for co-transformants carrying both plasmids.

4. **Interaction Assay**  
   Replica-plate transformants onto:
   - SD/-Leu/-Trp/-His (triple dropout, TDO) or
   - SD/-Leu/-Trp/-His/-Ade (quadruple dropout, QDO) plates
   Optionally, add 3-AT to suppress background HIS3 expression.

5. **Reporter Gene Analysis**  
   - **Growth Assays:** Growth on TDO or QDO media indicates interaction.
   - **Colorimetric Assays:** Use X-gal for lacZ-based blue/white screening.
   - **Fluorescence Assays:** Use GFP-expressing constructs in compatible strains.

### Optimization Strategies

- **Stringency Adjustment:** Increase 3-AT concentration to reduce false positives.
- **Autoactivation Check:** Confirm bait does not activate reporter in the absence of prey.
- **Positive/Negative Controls:** Always include known interacting and non-interacting pairs.
- **Protein Expression Validation:** Use western blot or tagged constructs to confirm bait/prey expression.
- **Multiple Colonies:** Test several independent transformants to control for clonal variability.

---

### Applications

- Mapping binary protein–protein interaction networks
- Identifying interactors of novel or uncharacterized proteins
- Dissecting domain-specific interactions or mutations
- Functional annotation of signaling and regulatory pathways

---

### Limitations and Considerations

- **False Positives:** May arise from overexpression or promiscuous binding.
- **False Negatives:** Some interactions may require post-translational modifications not present in yeast.
- **Non-native Environment:** Assay occurs in yeast nucleus, which may affect interaction dynamics.

### Conclusion

The yeast two-hybrid system is a cost-effective and scalable approach to detect protein–protein interactions in vivo. By understanding its chemical basis and optimizing transformation and screening conditions, researchers can leverage Y2H to dissect complex interactomes and identify novel regulatory mechanisms.
