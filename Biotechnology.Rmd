### Course Overview

This 5-day intensive course offers a foundational and applied exploration of **biotechnology**, focusing on key molecular tools, cellular systems, and industrial applications. The curriculum balances theory with real-world relevance to prepare students for research, translational, or commercial pursuits in modern biosciences. Each day builds conceptually on the last — progressing from molecular foundations to applied biomanufacturing and bioethics.

- DNA sequencing methods and data interpretation  
- Synthetic biology and genetic circuits  
- Applications in diagnostics, biosensors, and biomanufacturing  

> *Outcome:* Students will explore high-throughput technologies enabling systems-level understanding and design of biological systems.

---

### Day 5: Ethics, Regulation, and Innovation in Biotechnology

- Intellectual property (IP) in biotech: patents and licensing  
- Regulatory bodies (e.g., FDA, EMA, TGA) and approval pipelines  
- Bioethics: GMOs, gene editing, and human trials  
- Commercialization of biotech innovation  
- Entrepreneurship and career paths in biotechnology  

> *Outcome:* Students will gain insights into the ethical, legal, and commercial dimensions that guide biotech development and deployment.
